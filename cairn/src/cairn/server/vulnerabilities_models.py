"""Pydantic models for the vulnerability report engine.

This module is intentionally a standalone module (``vulnerabilities_models.py``)
rather than a ``models/vulnerabilities.py`` package member. The existing
``cairn.server.models`` is a single module (``models.py``) that is imported across
the dispatcher and server (``from cairn.server.models import ...``). Introducing a
``models/`` package would shadow that module and break those imports, so these
models live in their own additive module instead -- mirroring the convention
established by ``auth_models.py``.

The field shapes follow design.md (New Pydantic Models section) and map onto the
``vulnerabilities`` table created in ``product_db.py``.
